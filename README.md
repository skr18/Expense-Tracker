# Expense-Tracker
The React Expense Tracker project is an application designed to help users track and manage their expenses effectively. Built using the React library, it provides a user-friendly interface and implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to handle expense data.

The main features of the React Expense Tracker include:
1> Expense Listing: Users can view a list of their expenses, including details such as the expense name, amount, and date. The list provides an overview of all    recorded expenses.

2> Create Expense: Users can add new expenses by filling out a form that includes fields for the expense name, amount, and date. Upon submission, the new expense is added to the list, providing an up-to-date record of expenses.

3> Update Expense: The application allows users to modify existing expenses. By selecting an expense from the list, users can update its details, such as the expense name, amount, or date. The updated information is then reflected in the expense list.

4> Delete Expense: Users have the ability to remove expenses from the list entirely. By selecting an expense and confirming the deletion, the expense is permanently removed from the system.
